/*
You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

Example:
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.


Notes:

3 <= points.length <= 50.
No points will be duplicated.
 -50 <= points[i][j] <= 50.
Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.
